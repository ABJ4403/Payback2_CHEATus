# Usage
- Make sure your phone is rooted (i recommend using [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/magisk) because its open-source) to use [GameGuardian](https://gameguardian.net).
  - You can use GameGuardian without root in virtual environment, but it might not work.
  - (Recommended) because the game has so many ads, i recommend using Hosts AdBlocking, like [AdAway](https://adaway.org)
- Install The latest version of [GameGuardian](https://gameguardian.net).
- Install the latest "[Payback 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.apex_designs.payback2)" (if it does'nt work, download the version 2.104.12.4, i recommend getting it from [Aurora store](https://auroraoss.org), or use [APKMirror](https://apkmirror.com))
- Download the [cheat script](https://github.com/ABJ4403/Payback2_CHEATus/blob/main/Payback2_CHEATus.lua?raw=true).

# Why i make this?
Because i see Payback 2 players (notably cheaters) are very rude, and did'nt want to share their cheat script at all. This ofcourse violates open-source philosophy (because im foss oriented lol), we need to see the source code to make sure its safe and not malware. Just take a look at Hydra YouTube videos for example (Payback gamer name: HYDRAofINDONESIA). he's hiding every technique of cheating, the hiding is SO EXTREME (alot of sticker/text/zoom-censor, speedup, especially something related with memory address/value, or well... any number). even if he gives [download link of one cheat (wall-hack)](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2xekhqk3tsvwq69/WALL+HACK+payback2.lua/file), its still proprietary, i cant read any single code to make sure its not malware (and also if i look correctly in the code, theres word "[LOCKED]" and on the video description which he provides, theres garbled text that says "7o31kql9p", which means double-encryption! what the fucking hell dude?! get some mental health!), and also its whopping 200kb! I'm done. This is why the "Payback2 CHEATus" project comes
