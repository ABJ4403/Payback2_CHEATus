Payback2_CHEATus is a GameGuardian Lua Cheat Script for Payback 2.<br><br>
Warning: The developer is now aware of hackers/cheaters and thus constantly patching things.
This project may entering maintenance mode (no longer adding features).
If you can, only use this script in singleplayer or offline mode,
DO NOT use this on multiplayer or online mode!
Thank you for everyone that helps this project going until now.

## Features
- `üíªÔ∏èü§ùÔ∏èüì±Ô∏è Better compatibility` (Root/VM, CBSS(todo)/Anonymous(todo)/Other, GG/Standard Lua interpreter, even minifier/beautifier/compiler. All that works without problem, compatible with each other, crash rarely happens).
- `üóúÔ∏è Minified version available` (if you really need that tiny size. little note, its not bleeding-edge (very latest to the original script), its rarely updated except major updates...).
- `üìàÔ∏è Performance experiment` (optional).
- `üìàÔ∏è Memory restricted search` (only search in certain memory areas (warn that this might not work on phones with different RAM size (mine was 2GB, better optimized for OTHER memory region, not work on Anonymous region because how it works))).
- `üìàÔ∏è Memory Memoization` (technical feature that significantly accelerates searches on values that won't change alot).
- `ü¶†‚ùå 0-Malware` its because...
- `üí∞‚ùå FOSS (Free & Open-source)` the source code is not compiled (or even encrypted/obfuscated) so people can make sure this isn't malware.

This cheat is Open-source on GitHub (unlike any other cheats some cheater bastards not showing at all! they make it beyond proprietary)
