Why i make this:
Because i see Payback 2 players (notably cheaters) are very rude, and did'nt want to share their cheat script at all. This ofcourse violates open-source rules, we need to see the source code so that we can make sure its safe and not malware. Just take a look at Hydra for example (Payback gamer name: HydraAssasins/HYDRAofINDONESIA) YouTube videos. he's hiding every technique of cheating, the hiding is SO EXTREME. even if he gives download link of one cheat (wall-hack)

its still proprietary, i cant read any single code to make sure its not malware, and also its whopping 200kb! im done. this is why the "Payback2 CHEATus" project comes
