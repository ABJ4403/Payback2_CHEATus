- "PB2_WallHack.lua" ("WALL HACK payback2.lua" from "https://www.mediafire.com/file/2xekhqk3tsvwq69/WALL+HACK+payback2.lua/file"), by Hydra.
anyone can decrypt these files?

  Assembled and obfuscated in LUA languange (i hate lua. why gameguardian even use lua, why not use rust).

I can't upload these encrypted files due to unknown CORS failure when trying to upload to GitHub (idk why, maybe because github is using external stuff...)


# Warning:
**Use the assembled/obfuscated/encrypted script AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! I don't ever know if there is a MALWARE IN THESE SCRIPT or not.**

# Why i make this?
Because its VERY HARD to find these scripts dude...
