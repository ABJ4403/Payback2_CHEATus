# What the heck is this directory?
This directory is a list of collection of Payback 2 cheat LUA Script for GameGuardian

# Lists:
### ```FileName.lua``` (```ActualFileName.lua```, from [```some website```]()), By Author <(uploaded by Uploader)>

- ```PB2_Cheat-Mangyu.lua``` ("PAYBACK2.lua", from [```MediaFire```](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9m1s41x7fjorzrf/PAYBACK2.lua/file)), By Mangyu (uploaded by "Latic AX")
- ```PB2_ICE-Menu_v1.0.lua``` ("{1.0} PB 2.lua", from [```MediaFire```](https://www.mediafire.com/file/o1kgc0xbcjdyzac/%7B1.0%7D+PB+2.lua/file)), By Crystal_Mods100x (uploaded by "Toxic Coder")
- ```PB2_VIPTheSmat7Pro27-Mangyu.lua``` (from [```MediaFire```](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6t6hy9cdszcezpr/%25E2%259C%25A8SCRIPT_PAYBACK2_VIP_THE_SMAT7_PRO_27%25E2%259C%25A8_.lua.7z/file), fork of Mangyu's script), by VIPTheSmat7Pro27

	```Difficulty: 2``` ```🔐️ 7z+AES Encrypted``` ```🔏️ Decryptor: ABJ4403``` ```⚙️ Decryption tools: none``` ```⚙️ Requirement: 7z```

	Encrypted in 7z format, Password: ```LUA V1```. Where do i get this you say? from his video comment, because its in spanish i cant read it until i use Google Translate, everything revealed.
  Unfortunately, this script is just another modified version of Mangyu's cheat Script, didnt have any cheat changes except adding replacing ```Mangyu``` with his name ```THE SMAT7 PRO 27```, adding more bloat and stuff.

- ```PB2_GKTV_v1.lua``` (```Payback 2 - CHEAT [V1].lua``` from [```MediaFire```](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hros99ssjzmkp00/Payback_2_-_CHEAT_%255BV1%255D.lua/file)), by GKTV (now "Pumpkin Hacker")

	```Difficulty: 2``` ```🔏️ Decryptor: MDP43140``` ```💾️ Compiled binary``` ```💧️ Leaks variables``` ```⚙️ Decryption tools: [Custom Patched Unluac](https://sourceforge.net/p/unluac/discussion/general/thread/88e9b323cc/)``` ```⚙️ Requirement: [Java](https://java.com)```

	Thankfully unlike others, this one is a bit easy. i cant decrypt this using unluac/luadec, i just need the patched custom unluac that has modified non-standard OPCodes.
	Then it works
	

## HELP WANTED decryption:
anyone can decrypt these files?
- ```PB2_Hydra-WallHack.lua``` (```WALL HACK payback2.lua``` from [```MediaFire```](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2xekhqk3tsvwq69/WALL+HACK+payback2.lua/file)), by Hydra.

	```Difficulty: 3``` ```🛡️ Obfuscation``` ```🔐️ Built-in lock```

  Assembled and obfuscated in LUA languange (i hate lua. why gameguardian even use lua, why not use rust).

- ```PB2_AlphaGGHackerYT_simplescriptv1.lua``` (```Payback 2 ❰ ☠ ᴇɴᴄ ☠ ❱``` from [```MediaFire```](https://www.mediafire.com/file/og6r5ppblfzd36s/Payback_2__%25E2%259D%25B0_%25E2%2598%25A0_%25E1%25B4%2587%25C9%25B4%25E1%25B4%2584_%25E2%2598%25A0_%25E2%259D%25B1.lua/file)), by "Alpha GG Hacker YT".

	```Difficulty: 4``` ```🛡️ Obfuscation``` ```💾️ Assembly Compiled binary```  ```🔒️ Built-in Encryption``` ```🤬️ R*c*st```

	Ridicilous Arbitrary slow loading embedded on the script with 0 way to bypass that at all.

	Assembled, Obfuscated, Encrypted. All that + the author bullying you in the code itself (the text says ```N O O B   D E C R Y P T   ( F * * *   Y O U )``` on the end of the raw binary file, and ```NoTouchyTouchy```,```OopsSorry``` when disassembling the file).
	
	Yeah... looks like he's flexing on his ```🛡️🔒🛡️ new proprietary PHILIPPINES's super 👹️ic 666 military-grade encryption 🛡️🔒🛡️``` that wont even launch the script at all (yes i cant open the script because the encryption was too much even for gameguardian itself lol XD)

I can't upload these encrypted files due to unknown CORS failure when trying to upload to GitHub (idk why, maybe because github is using external stuff...)

# Warning:
**Use the assembled/obfuscated/encrypted script AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! I don't ever know if there is a MALWARE IN THESE SCRIPT or not.**

# Why i make this?
Because its VERY HARD to find these scripts dude...

# Challenge for decryptors
i will give a challenge here for decryptors. anyone that can decrypt these scripts and send it to me (not just some showcase pay shit, cuz were foss (open-source) community here, people's here are donated not paid, aka. paying is optional), i will give EXCLUSIVE ```decryptor``` credit on GitHub Main ReadMe section and script_collection Readme section (yeah i dont hav money so that is the only thing i can pay for lol)
