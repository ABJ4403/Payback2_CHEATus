# What the heck is this directory?
This directory is a list of collection of Payback 2 cheat LUA Script for GameGuardian

# Lists:
### `FileName.lua` (`ActualFileName.lua`, from [`some website`]()), By Author <(uploaded by Uploader)>

- `PB2_Cheat-Mangyu.lua` ("PAYBACK2.lua", from [`MediaFire`](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9m1s41x7fjorzrf/PAYBACK2.lua/file)), By Mangyu (uploaded by "Latic AX")
- `PB2_ICE-Menu_v1.0.lua` ("{1.0} PB 2.lua", from [`MediaFire`](https://www.mediafire.com/file/o1kgc0xbcjdyzac/%7B1.0%7D+PB+2.lua/file)), By Crystal_Mods100x (uploaded by "Toxic Coder")
- `PB2_VIPTheSmat7Pro27-Mangyu.lua` (from [`MediaFire`](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6t6hy9cdszcezpr/%25E2%259C%25A8SCRIPT_PAYBACK2_VIP_THE_SMAT7_PRO_27%25E2%259C%25A8_.lua.7z/file), fork of Mangyu's script), by VIPTheSmat7Pro27

	`Difficulty: 2` `🔏️ Decryptor: ABJ4403` `🔐️ 7z+AES Encrypted` `⚙️ Decryption tools: none` `⚙️ Requirement: 7z`

	Encrypted in 7z format, Password: `LUA V1`. Where do i get this you say? from his video comment, because its in spanish i cant read it until i use Google Translate, everything revealed.
  Unfortunately, this script is just another modified version of Mangyu's cheat Script, didnt have any cheat changes except adding replacing `Mangyu` with his name `THE SMAT7 PRO 27`, adding more bloat and stuff.

- `PB2_GKTV_v1.lua` (`Payback 2 - CHEAT [V1].lua` from [`MediaFire`](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hros99ssjzmkp00/Payback_2_-_CHEAT_%255BV1%255D.lua/file)), by GKTV (now "Pumpkin Hacker")

	`Difficulty: 2` `🔏️ Decryptor: MDP43140` `💾️ Compiled binary` `💧️ Leaks variables` `⚙️ Decryption tools: Custom Patched unluac` `⚙️ Requirement: Java`

	Thankfully unlike others, this one is a bit easy. i cant decrypt this using unluac/luadec, i just need the patched custom unluac that has modified non-standard OPCodes.
	Then it works
	
- `PB2_Hydra-WallHack.lua` (`WALL HACK payback2.lua` from [`MediaFire`](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2xekhqk3tsvwq69/WALL+HACK+payback2.lua/file)), by Hydra.

	`Difficulty: 3` `🔏️ Decryptor: ABJ4403, tehtmi` `🛡️ Obfuscation (level:3)` `🔐️String Encryption (difficulty:3)` `🔐️ Password: 7o31kql9p0` `📈️ Function argument overflow` `✏️ Bytecode modification` `💣️ Decompression bomb` `❌️ Anti-decompiler` `⚙️ Decryption tools: unluac` `⚙️ Requirement: Java, text-editor that supports replacing newlines`

  Finally i had this file decrypted (kindof) , Thank you [tehtmi](https://sourceforge.net/u/tehtmi) (Unluac developer) for some decryption stuff.
  Actually what happened that is the file had some nonsense, this will be visible if you dissasemble the file:
```

settable     r59   r71   r71
loadnil      r59     0
test         r59     0
move         r74   r59
test         r59     0
loadbool     r59     0     0
settable     r59   r71   r71
call         r71     1     1
settable     r71    k8   r74
test         r59     0
settable     r74   r77   r79
gettable     r79   r71   r79
loadnil      r71     8
newtable     r71     0     0
```
  and this nonsense: ```loadk         r0   k36```.
  both fills the script alot and confuses unluac, eats ~100-200kb size. just disassemble the file, remove all that above, reassemble the file, and decompile it again using patched unluac, it will work.

	I know this isn't really 'decompiled' because bunch of variables were gone, replaced by A\*_\* and its huge (400kb), so this makes it harder to reverse-engineer.

	`Difficulty: 4` `🔏️ Decryptor: ABJ4403, tehtmi, mdp43140` `🛡️ Obfuscation (level:2)` `🔒️ String Encryption (difficulty:2)` `💾️ Assembly Compiled binary` `📈️ Function argument overflow` `❌️ Anti-decompiler` `🤬️ R*c*st` `⚙️ Decryption tools: unluac-patched` `⚙️ Requirement: Java, text-editor that supports replacing newlines`

	Ridicilous Arbitrary slow loading embedded on the script with 0 way to bypass that at all.

	Assembled, Obfuscated, Encrypted + the author bullying you in the code itself (even though he missed one thing... password, which is a good thing).
	
	OR AM I? its DECOMPILED, so he thought his encryption works like a charm, eh?

	this one is almost the same as the hydra wallhack ones, but simpler (if u successfully decompile the script and getting rid of nonsense stuff...)

	One thing to point put though, AlphaGG put the string decryption thing on the top

	Thanks again to [tehtmi](https://sourceforge.net/u/tehtmi) for the patched unluac, and [mdp43140](https://github.com/mdp43140) for reverse-engineering to get the password.

# Warning:
**Use the assembled/obfuscated/encrypted script AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! I don't ever know if there is a MALWARE IN THESE SCRIPT or not.**

# Why i make this?
Because its VERY HARD to find these scripts dude...

# Challenge for decryptors
i will give a challenge here for decryptors. anyone that can decrypt these scripts and send it to me (not just some showcase pay shit, cuz were foss (open-source) community here, people's here are donated not paid, aka. paying is optional), i will give EXCLUSIVE `decryptor` credit on GitHub Main ReadMe section and script_collection Readme section (yeah i dont hav money so that is the only thing i can pay for lol)
