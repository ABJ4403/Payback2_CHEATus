	Difficulty: 3


- "PB2_AlphaGGHackerYT_simplescriptv1.lua" ("Payback 2 ‚ù∞ ‚ò† ·¥á…¥·¥Ñ ‚ò† ‚ù±" from "[MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/og6r5ppblfzd36s/Payback_2__%25E2%259D%25B0_%25E2%2598%25A0_%25E1%25B4%2587%25C9%25B4%25E1%25B4%2584_%25E2%2598%25A0_%25E2%259D%25B1.lua/file)"), by "Alpha GG Hacker YT".

	Ridicilous Arbitrary slow loading embedded on the script with 0 way to bypass that at all.

	Assembled, Obfuscated, Encrypted. All that + the author bullying you in the code itself (the text says ```N O O B   D E C R Y P T   ( F * * *   Y O U )``` on the end of the raw binary file, and ```NoTouchyTouchy```,```OopsSorry``` when disassembling the file).
	
	Yeah... looks like he's flexing on his ```new proprietary PHILIPPINES's super satanic 666 military-grade encryption üõ°Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è``` that wont even launch the script at all (yes i cant open the script because the encryption was too much even for gameguardian itself lol XD)

	Difficulty: 4


- "PB2_GKTV_v1.lua" ("Payback 2 - CHEAT [V1].lua" from "[MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hros99ssjzmkp00/Payback_2_-_CHEAT_%255BV1%255D.lua/file)"), by GKTV (now "Pumpkin Hacker")

	Thankfully unlike others, this one is a bit easy, but i just cant decompile it using unluac.

	If you want to decompile this using unluac, if it errors, reassemble the binary file (there might be error coming, that error you remove the said text)

	Difficulty: 2

I can't upload these encrypted files due to unknown CORS failure when trying to upload to GitHub (idk why, maybe because github is using external stuff...)

# Warning:
